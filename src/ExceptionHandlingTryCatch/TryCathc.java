/*
 * Explain Exceptional Handling ? 
 * 
 * Answer:
 * Which ever line is giving you exception should be in try block And it must be
 * handled in the catch block Writing exception handling code doesnâ€™t mean
 * exception will come,it may come or it may not come If exception is coming
 * then try block will not execute and catch block will execute
