/*OUTPUT:
  Common elements: [4, 5]
  Key Concepts
  HashSet: Used to store unique elements and allows for efficient lookup operations. The contains method has an average time complexity of O(1).
  Set Interface: The Set interface is used to store elements without duplicates, making it ideal for finding common elements.
  This program is an efficient way to find common elements between two arrays, especially with the help of the HashSet for fast lookups.
